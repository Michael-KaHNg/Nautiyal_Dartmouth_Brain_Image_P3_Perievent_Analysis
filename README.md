# Random Permutation 

# Background
Data relating to reaction time and physiological signals are limited by physical constraints.  There is only so fast our muscles groups can move,  or for a cells sodium-potassium pump to restore the resting poential. As a result, those data are not suitable for use with parametric methods that relies on the initial believe of normal distribution.
